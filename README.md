# ft_printf_42

In this project, we want to reproduce the behavior of printf(). This code is only for the mandatory part, which means:
  a) This ft_printf() doesn't take into account the precision nor minimum fields width;
  b) Likewise, it doesn't take into account none of the flags (0-+# );

# Things learned from the project:
   - Break it into small chunks 
   This was my first **big** project in Ecole 42-SP (I aimed for the bonus at first). In summary, this means I spent days doing a diagram to **divide and conquer**    the ft_printf(). In the end I delivered the mandatory (which does only the conversions, if any), but from now on I feel more confident and secure about projects    like this.
